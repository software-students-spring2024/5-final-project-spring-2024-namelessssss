# Nameless Weather App

The Nameless Weather App is a web-based weather forecasting web-based application that utilizes OpenWeatherMap's API in order to collect real-time weather data.
Users may use the web application's user-friendly interface to select which major city they would like to retrieve weather information about and to select their preferred temperature unit.
The app then displays real-time information about the weather in that city, including its temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather condition.
